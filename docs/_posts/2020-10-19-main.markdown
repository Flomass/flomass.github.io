I am a researcher ("Chargé de recherche") in bioinformatics and biostatistics working at the [Centre for Computational Biology][CBIO], a research center of [Mines ParisTech][Mines] and [institut Curie][Curie] in Paris. <br/> 

My work aims at understanding the cause and consequences of genomic changes and their link to human health. You can find a more detailed description of my research topics [here][Research].

I did my PhD (2012-2015) at the [MaIAGE][MaIAGE] unit in Paris' suburb under the cosupervision of Sophie Schbath and Peter Arndt. The goal of my work was to study the statistical properties of eukaryotic genomes, with a special focus on various mechanism of gene duplication. My manuscript is avaiable [here][PhD].

After that, I did my first postdoc at the [LBBE][LBBE] in Lyon where I studied the evolution of replication origins.
During my second postdoc, I worked on cancer genomics in the [Evolutionary and Cancer Genomics lab][Schwarz] at the [Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicin][mdc] in Berlin. <br/>
