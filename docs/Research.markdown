# Research Themes

My work aims at understanding the cause and consequences of genomic changes and their link to human health.
I work on three main research questions:

## Horizontal Gene Transfer in Bacteria

Recent advances of sequencing technologies have allowed the analysis of microbial
communities via sequencing of the metagenomes of a variety of different environments, further
highlighting the crucial importance of microorganisms on human health. The huge amount of data
generated this way constitutes a tremendous opportunity to improve our understanding of
microorganismsâ€™ biology, but also requires the development of efficient dedicated methods.

The ability of bacteria belonging to different species to exchange genetic material via
Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is a key mechanism of microorganisms evolution and constitutes an
important source of genetic novelty for microbial species. On short timescales it is the primary
reason for the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria [1][1] and plays an important role in the
evolution of virulence [2][2], and as such is of crucial importance for human health. HGT occurs via
various mechanisms and has been studied in detail for specific bacterial families. However, HGT
events occurring between distantly related organisms -- allowing for a rapid spread of antibiotic
resistance and virulence factors -- remain poorly studied. Notably, the biological conditions that
make long distance HGT possible, and influence the rates at which species exchange material are not
understood. In addition, whether these transfers are direct or are mediated via intermediate carrier
species, and the routes that genes take to spread via HGT over the tree of life are mostly unknown.

We recently developed a method to identify HGT in bacteria [3][3]. The principle of our method
is that long sequences of DNA (>300bp) exactly identical between pairs of bacteria of different
species are extremely unlikely to occur via classical vertical inheritance. Hence, such long exact
matches must result from a recent HGT event. Using efficient algorithms detecting exact matches at
low computation cost, we applied this method to all 90,000 species of the refSeq database and
discovered over 100,000 HGT events. Analyzing the statistical properties of these matches, we
estimated the HGT rate between any of the 8,000 genera of bacteria, providing the most
comprehensive map of HGT across the bacterial world. This database makes it possible to study the
properties of HGT at a global scale. Still, the stringent statistical threshold we used to avoid false
positives reduces the power of our method, leading to discovering only a subset of all HGT events.


## Early Detection of  Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths in the western world. A
direct connection to lifestyle risk in the form of cigarette smoke has long been established, and ex
smokers remain at risk since >50% of all lung cancers occur in former smokers. On the other hand,
only 10-20% of heavy smokers ever develop lung cancer in the course of their lifetime, raising
questions about the factors that can explain such variability. It has been postulated that individual
differences in smoke injury response might modulate personal cancer risk and that cancer onset
results from the combination of environmental exposure and disadvantageous genetic background.
Early studies into the gene expression dynamics induced by smoke exposure provided a broad
characterisation of the genes involved [6]. However, the lack of statistical power of these studies
have prevented the discovery of individual differences among smokers. As a consequence, the role
of subject specific genetic background in response to smoke injury remains poorly understood.
